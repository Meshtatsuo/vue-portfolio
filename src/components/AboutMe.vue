        <p>
          After graduating college in 2016, I worked various odd jobs while
          freelancing as a sound engineer and audio programmer on the side. My
          experience designing audio systems for games motivated me to go back
          to school and learn what it takes to be a full stack developer. During
          school I built several web applications, including:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            A photo reviewing application that allows photographers to create
            clients and upload photos for their clients' approval.
          </li>
          <li>
            A desktop and mobile music player built using web technologies and
            Electron.
          </li>
          <li>
            A mental health check in application that allows you to keep tabs on
            your mental health.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          The skills picked up on my development journey have enabled me to take
          on some pretty exciting projects, and I'm looking forward to diving
          into my next!
