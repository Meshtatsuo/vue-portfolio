    I was the project manager for FIXTURE. I coordinated with my group to assign responsibilities, created and managed the GitHub repo including project and issue tracking, and I also took a major role in the front end development. I also worked on the back-end near the end of MVP development to fix bugs and implement additional necessary features.
